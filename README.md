# Banking-system-on-oops-
Good day to u mates .I created a small project not a fancy one on the topic of oops as due to i was practising it so i made the project so that i can more beautifully understand it and help me for more  work.

Now in the following if u have asking yurself "why did i make 2 files I.e "script" and then "bank_accounts" thus causing more work .I created the 2 files as script file contains the input and bank_accounts file contain the whole program and this helps me in the following way:- 

> The seperate input file does not let the viewer to find the input in the big code thus causing less confusion(also it gives a little style also 😅)
> The another file ontains the complete programme which will help the viewer to concentrate to work more on the 
 program rather than on the input . So that if any error occurs then he could more give attention to the code and which will   help him to concentrate only on the coe
